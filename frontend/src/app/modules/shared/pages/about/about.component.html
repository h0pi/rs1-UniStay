          <h3 class="section-title">How UniStay Works (Process Overview)</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The journey with UniStay is simple and intuitive. It begins with a student submitting an online application. The dorm management team then reviews applications and assigns rooms through the system. Once moved in, students can submit maintenance requests, which are automatically routed to the maintenance staff. Throughout the year, administrators use the platform for announcements, ensuring clear communication and a well-managed community.</p>
